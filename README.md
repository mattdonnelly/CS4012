CS4012 Solutions
================

This repo contains my solutions to labs for Trinity College Dublin's CS4012: Topics in Functional Programming
module 2014.

## Requirements

All lab solutions are written in haskell and require you to install both the Glasgow Haskell Compiler and the Cabal package system. This can be done by installing the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) or using homebrew by running ```brew install ghc && brew install cabal```.
